A Firefox browser extension that automatically detects and downloads hero media (images/videos) from webpages, including Instagram carousels.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Automatic Detection**: Intelligently identifies the largest/most prominent media on any webpage
- 📷 **Instagram Support**: Full support for posts, carousels, reels, and videos
- 🔄 **Batch Processing**: Process multiple URLs at once with configurable delays
- 💾 **Original Quality**: Downloads media in original format and quality
- 🎠 **Carousel Support**: Automatically downloads all items from Instagram carousels
- ⚡ **Smart Filtering**: Excludes icons, avatars, and UI elements
- 🔐 **Session Support**: Uses your logged-in browser session (no separate login needed)

## 📋 Requirements

- Firefox 115 or later
- Node.js 18+ (for development)
- npm 9+ (for development)

## 🚀 Installation

### For Users

The extension is not signed by Mozilla, so regular Firefox will refuse to install it permanently via `about:addons`. Load it as a temporary add-on instead:

1. Download the latest release `.xpi` (or `.zip`) file from [Releases](https://github.com/marcoguastalli/media-hero-catch/releases)
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on…"
4. Select the downloaded `.xpi` file

Note: temporary add-ons are removed when Firefox restarts. For a permanent install you need [Firefox Developer Edition or Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) with `xpinstall.signatures.required` set to `false` in `about:config` — then the `about:addons` → gear icon → "Install Add-on From File" route works.

### For Developers

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcoguastalli/media-hero-catch.git
   cd media-hero-catch
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Load the extension in Firefox:
   ```bash
   npm run start:firefox
   ```

   Or manually:
   - Open Firefox
   - Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select `manifest.json` from the project directory

## 📖 Usage

1. Click the extension icon in Firefox toolbar
2. Paste one or more URLs (one per line) in the textarea
3. Optionally adjust the delay between processing URLs
4. Click "Process All"
5. Media files will be downloaded to your `~/Downloads` folder

### Supported Sites

- ✅ Instagram (posts, carousels, reels, videos)
- ✅ Any website with images/videos (generic detection)
- ✅ Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.

npm run start:firefox       # Run in Firefox
npm run validate            # Run all checks (CI)
```

### Running Tests

All tests are fully isolated and do not require internet access:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:unit
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `.zip` file in the `dist/` directory ready for distribution.

## 🧪 Testing

The project maintains >90% code coverage with comprehensive test suites:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules with mock data
- **Integration Tests**: Test component communication and workflows
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows with automated browser

All tests use mock HTML fixtures from `test-fixtures/` - no external network calls.
